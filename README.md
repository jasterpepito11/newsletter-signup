## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS v4.0](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev) - React Dev Tool
- [Bun v1.2](https://bun.sh/docs) - All-in-one toolkit for js/ts apps(drop-in replacement for nodejs)

### What I learned

I experimented with the tech stack I used with this challenge. I was kind of intrigued with the Bun 1.2
and tried to use it with a Vite-React project that uses TailwindCSS v4.0. It was fun exploring 

### Continued development

I wanted to focus on developing with react in the future and will still try to experiment with
the tech-stack that is compatible with it for the future challenges.


### Useful resources

- [React Spinners by David Hu](https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/) - This helped me for loading panel. I really liked this component as it is easy to use and fully documented.
